Kalk

A silly calculator experiment with MobX

`yarn && yarn build` then open `index.html` in your browser. There's also `yarn watch`.

For tests: `yarn run test`, `yarn test-watch` and `yarn-coverage` (see [ts-jest#378](https://github.com/kulshekhar/ts-jest/issues/378))

## Versions

- [v1.0](https://github.com/dmitriid/kalk/tree/v1.0) - MobX store as a global object

- [v2.x](https://github.com/dmitriid/kalk/tree/2.1) â€” MobX store passed in as props via `Provider` and `inject`
